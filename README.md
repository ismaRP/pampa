__PAMPA (Protein Analysis by Mass Spectrometry for Ancient Species)__ is a versatile software suite tailored to effectively handle various tasks associated with ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) data and peptide markers.


## Installation

PAMPA is written in Python 3.7, and can be installed either by downloading the source code or cloning this repository.  

 - downloading, as a zip file: button _code<>_ on the right-hand side of the screen
 - cloning: `git clone https://github.com/touzet/pampa.git`

PAMPA necessitates the Biopython, pyteomics and scipy libraries.  

 - biopython (https://biopython.org/)
 - pyteomics (https://pypi.org/project/pyteomics/)
 - scipy.stats (https://scipy.org/)

## Documentation
